push- Incorrect implementation.
      A counter Example- If we put o = null then  the inv is incorrect.
      o can be null.
      We can fix it by add "o != null" to the @pre.
pop- Correct implementation.
Top- Correct implementation.
isEmpty- Incorrect implementation.
         A counter Example- If we put linkedlist with size 1 (with 1 element) then the function will return false because 1!=0 but the inv. said it's should
        return true.
        We can fix it by correcting the inv. to "@post @return == true iff elements.size() == 0"
